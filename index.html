        <h2>Video Game Preservation</h2>
            <p>One of things that interests me the most is the topic of video game preservation. Video Game Preservation is the practice of archiving video games so they won't be lost forever.<br>
                Heres some of the reasons why video game preservation is important.

        <h3>Data degredation or 'Bit Rot':</h3>

            <p>The media that video games run off of was designed to last, but wasn't designed to last forever.<br>
                The data integrity can change based on the media type or the standard of quality that it was manufatured under.<br>
                Media can last from decades to down to several years.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples of media are:<br>

                      <td>Memory Chips</td>
                      <td>Video Game Cartridges, Arcade Boards</td>

        <h3>Lost source code:</h3>
        <img src="images\Source Code.jpg" alt="Source Code" width="500" height="333"> 
        <p>
            Something that might take people by surprise is that when a lot of companies develop video games, after they are released and sold, companies will not archive their source code.<br>
            <img src="images\Source Code Thrown Away.jpg" alt="Source Code Being Thrown Away" width="500" height="500"> <br>
            It will simply be thrown away. When this is done it makes it very hard for games to be re-released on newer platforms.

        <h3>Version Differences:</h3>
        <p>
            When games and consoles are released in different regions sometimes things are changed depending on the region. Reasons why can vary between culture differences to legal reasons.<br>

        <h3>Prototypes and Unreleased Games:</h3>
        <p>
            Archiving these are very useful for the aspect of understanding the mindset behind the development process of the game. Also it is very useful for seeing ideas that we're considered but eventually scrapped for various reasons.<br>
